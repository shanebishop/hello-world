This is my first repository on GitHub!

Hi, I'm Shane Bishop. I am currently a computer science student studying at Carleton University. 
I'm in my first year and the whole university experience is still very new and I am still trying to adapt.
Also, this is my first time living by myself and my first time living in a big city, so this is a really
big change for me.

I am nineteen years and four months old. For the first nineteen years and two months of my life I lived 
on St. Joseph Island, ON. Since pretty well nobody knows where that is, it is near Sault Ste. Marie, ON,
and if you don't know where that is, it is where the Great Lakes meet.

In terms of my education, I was homeschooled until Grade 5, and then attended public school until 
graduating from my local highschool last year. I had taken an extra year to obtain additional advanced
secondary school credits before starting out at university. I have taken two courses previously in Java,
and this year at Carleton I am currently taking a course in Python.

My hobbies are computers (obviously), percussion, soccer, reading, video games, and watching anime.
